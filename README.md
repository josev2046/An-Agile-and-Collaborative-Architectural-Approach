# An Agile and Collaborative Architectural Approach

Am often asked about my approach building successful prototypes with the blessings of the client. Drawing inspiration from my time at IBM using their Cloud Garage methodology, I have cultivated a dynamic and collaborative architectural practice â€” an approach that prioritises rapid, iterative delivery of value, ensuring that the solution remains aligned with a client's evolving business needs and technical realities.

The core methodology is centred on a continuous feedback loop and a deep-seated belief that the most successful solutions are co-created with the client. The process is not about defining a rigid blueprint at the outset, but rather about establishing a flexible framework that can absorb new information and pivot as required. This reduces risk and ensures that the final product is not only technically robust but also genuinely addresses the client's most pressing business challenges.

## Key Stages in Practice

The core of this methodology is a series of somewhat obvious key stages, each designed to mitigate risk and accelerate time-to-value:

### 1. Ideation & Discovery  
The fun part: the journey begins with a collaborative workshop to define a clear problem statement and a shared vision. This is a crucial phase for developing *user empathy* and aligning all stakeholders on the business opportunity. The objective is to identify a hypothesis that can be tested in the subsequent stages. Yep, loads of post-its.

### 2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition  
Following ideation, we define the Minimum Viable Product. This is not merely a stripped-down version of the final solution, but a highly focused, functional application designed to test our core hypothesis and validate key assumptions. This stage is critical for gaining early, on-site validation from end-users.

### 3. Iterative Development & Refinement  
The MVP is built using agile and DevOps practices, with a strong emphasis on continuous integration and delivery. We work in sprints, with a prioritised backlog of user stories. Regular check-ins and on-site validations ensure we are on track and can quickly adapt to new feedback.

### 4. Harden, Scale, and Operate  
Once the MVP has been validated, we shift our focus to hardening the solution for production. This involves scaling the architecture, integrating with existing systems, and ensuring the solution is resilient and secure for long-term operation.

## A Typical Architectural Flow

To illustrate the collaborative nature of this process, consider this as a typical engagement sequence:

By adhering to this agile and user-centric model, we ensure that the architectural vision is not only sound but also intrinsically tied to the practical needs of the business and its users. It is an approach that values collaboration, embraces change, and consistently delivers tangible value.
