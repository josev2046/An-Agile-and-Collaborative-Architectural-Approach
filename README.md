# Prototyping in Practice: An Agile and Collaborative Approach

When was the last time you saw a prototype win over a client — not because it was perfect, but because it was just enough to prove the idea?

I’m often asked about my approach to building successful prototypes that get the client’s blessing. Drawing on my time at IBM using their Cloud Garage methodology, I’ve settled on a collaborative way of working that prioritises one simple thing: the rapid, iterative delivery of real value. It’s an approach that ensures the solution stays aligned with a client’s evolving business needs and the technical realities on the ground.

The core philosophy is that the most successful solutions are co-created with the client. It’s not about defining a rigid blueprint from the outset, but rather establishing a flexible framework that can absorb new information and pivot when needed. This is a sensible way to reduce risk and ensure the final product isn't just technically sound, but genuinely solves the client’s most pressing problems.

## Key Stages in the Process

Our process is centred on four key stages, each designed to mitigate risk and get to a valuable outcome faster.

### 1. Ideation & Discovery: Getting to the Heart of the Matter  
The fun part. The journey begins with a collaborative workshop to define a clear problem statement and a shared vision. This phase is crucial for developing *user empathy* and getting all stakeholders aligned on the opportunity. The objective is to identify a core hypothesis we can test. And yes, this usually involves a mountain of Post-it notes.

At this stage, it often makes sense to cobble up a **rapid prototype** — even a rough one — to bring ideas to life, align expectations, and quickly check if the proposed solution resonates.

### 2. MVP Definition: Proving the Concept  
Following ideation, we define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This is not simply a stripped-down version of the final product. It’s a highly focused, functional application designed to test our core hypothesis and validate key assumptions with actual end-users. This stage is critical for getting that early, on-the-ground feedback.

### 3. Iterative Development & Refinement: Building in Cycles  
The MVP is built using agile and DevOps practices, with a strong emphasis on continuous integration and delivery. We work in sprints from a prioritised backlog of user stories. Regular check-ins and on-site validations ensure we’re on the right track and can quickly adjust our course based on new feedback.

### 4. Harden, Scale, and Operate: Making It Production-Ready  
Once the MVP has been validated, we shift our focus to hardening the solution for production. This means scaling the architecture, integrating with existing systems, and ensuring the solution is resilient and secure for the long haul.

## A Typical Architectural Flow  

To illustrate the collaborative nature of this process, this diagram shows a typical engagement sequence:

By sticking to this agile and user-centric model, we ensure that the architectural vision is not only sound but intrinsically tied to the practical needs of the business. It’s an approach that values collaboration, embraces change, and consistently delivers tangible value.

The key question, however, remains: **what do you think makes a prototype powerful — its technical depth, or its ability to spark the right conversations?**
